motility documentation
======================

**motility** is a C++ library for searching DNA sequences with several
different types of motif representations, from the simplest case
(string literals!) to IUPAC-style motifs (e.g. WGATAR),
Position-Weight Matrices (PWMs), and energy operators. It also has a
simple Python interface which renders it almost immediately useful
from the command line; the Python interface also supports reading of
the JASPAR and TFD libraries of binding sites.

The current version of motility is **0.8.1**, and it's available `here
<http://cartwheel.caltech.edu/motility/motility-0.8.1.tar.gz>`__.  You
can also visit the development site at http://cartwheel.idyll.org/, and
use Subversion to get the development version of motility here:
