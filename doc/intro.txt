motility: A C++/Python toolkit for sequence motif searching
===========================================================

**motility** is a C++ library for searching DNA sequences with several
different types of motif representations, from the simplest case
(string literals!)  to IUPAC-style motifs (e.g. ``WGATAR``),
Position-Weight Matrices (PWMs), and energy operators.  It also has
a simple Python interface which renders it almost immediately useful
from the command line.

See the associated ``c++-interface`` and ``python-interface`` docs for
more info on how to use this library from C++ or Python.

**motility** is used both in FamilyRelations II (FRII) and in
a variety of ad-hoc script-writing projects.

supported motif types
---------------------

There's really only a small set of motif representations that are used
in the Real World; here's a list of the ones that motility knows about.


**string literals**
       This is the simplest kind of motif; ``GACCA`` matches
       to either ``GACCA`` or its reverse complement ``TGGTC``.

       In practice, you can do the same thing with IUPAC notation (below)
       in a better and more flexible way, so the string literal functions
       are not so useful, but it was good practice to write 'em ;).

**IUPAC notation**
       This notation is the same as string literals except that it permits
       some uncertainty (or degeneracy) in each position: e.g. ``WGATAR``
       matches an A or a T, followed by a GATA, followed by an A or a G,
       in both forward and reverse complement sequence.  See iupac symbols_
       below.

       Please note that *motility* can also generate IUPAC matches with
       an arbitrary number of mismatches.

**Position-Weight Matrices**
       Position-Weight Matrices (PWM) are matrix representations of
       motifs that allows for fairly flexible matching to individual
       bases.  For example, for the sequence 'WGATAR' the PWM would
       look like

       :: 

            ( A C G T )
          1.  1 0 0 1
          2.  0 0 1 0
	  3.  1 0 0 0
	  4.  0 0 0 1
	  5.  1 0 0 0
	  6.  1 0 1 0

       and the PWM score for any given sequence would be the sum of the
       scores in the matrix element corresponding to the letter in each
       position, e.g. the score would be 6 for the sequence ``AGATAA`` and
       the score would be 5 for the sequence ``CGATAA``.

       Because the weights can vary to any floating point value, fairly
       subtle variations can be constructed to e.g. overemphasize core
       sites in matches or underemphasize the centers of dimer binding sites.

       PWMs were developed by computer scientists, I think.

**Energy Operators**
       The inverse of position-weight matrices, in some sense.  It is another
       matrix representation that allows for weighting of independent
       bases, but the weights are the inverse of PWM weights: the *lower* the
       match score, the better the match.  So, for example, the consensus
       motif usually has a weight of 0 in a normalized energy operator matrix.

       This notation was developed by physicists to mimic the binding
       energy of proteins to DNA: if a DNA/protein binding interaction
       is at a minimum along a given sequence, it is the most stable
       interaction available to that protein.  Gibbs sampling tends to use
       energy operator notation.

       Obviously PWMs and energy operators are interconvertible, but
       it's done rather rarely because there's really no point in choosing
       one over the other.  Also, if converting multiple motifs, you may
       run into problems normalizing the maximum and minimum scores to
       get comparable results.

**IUPAC symbols:**

The following are the IUPAC symbols for nucleotides:

::

         A            A           Adenine
         C            C           Cytosine
         G            G           Guanine
         T            T           Thymine
         U            U           Uracil
         M          A or C
         R          A or G
         W          A or T
         S          C or G
         Y          C or T
         K          G or T
         V        A or C or G
         H        A or C or T
         D        A or G or T
         B        C or G or T
         N      G or A or T or C

Note that 'X' (normally the same as 'N') is not supported by motility
because it's silly.  If it's a problem let me know.
