Using motility to look for motifs
=================================

motility is a C++ and Python toolkit that I wrote for the purpose
of searching DNA sequences for transcription factor binding sites
with exact matches, IUPAC motifs, and matrices.

(These examples use motility 0.8.1, released on or around Dec 10th, 2007.)

Doing a simple sequence search
==============================

Suppose we have a sequence that we want to search for matches to a
specific motif (written in capital letters, to guide the eye):

 >>> sequence = "atatatatatatataaGGCCaatatatatata"
 >>> motif = "GG"

You can do a straightforward motility search pretty easily, with `find_exact`:

 >>> import motility
 >>> motility.find_exact(sequence, motif)
 ((16, 18, 1, 'GG'), (18, 20, -1, 'GG'))

This function returns a tuple of tuples, containing start, stop, orientation,
and the match sequence; in fact, all of the functions return this, so you
can treat return values from any motility search function the same way.

For example, you can iterate over it like this:

 >>> for (start, stop, orient, match) in motility.find_exact(sequence, motif):
 ...   print start, stop, orient, match
 16 18 1 GG
 18 20 -1 GG

Note that (as you would also expect) ``find_exact`` finds reverse complement
matches as well as forward matches, but it reports the motif matches in
the proper orientation.

Before we move on to more interesting functions, there's one other thing
to note: motility will detect if the search is being done with a palindrome,
and, if it is, only a single match will be returned.  So, for example, you
get this result:

 >>> motility.find_exact(sequence, 'GGCC')
 ((16, 20, 1, 'GGCC'),)

because 'GGCC' is a palindrome and it matches bases 16 -> 20 in both
directions.

Doing fuzzy searches with IUPAC motifs
======================================

One of the more popular motif searching techniques is to use a fuzzy
"IUPAC" motif; IUPAC stands for the "International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry", and they have a standard representation for DNA
bases.  For example, 'R' represents a purine, 'A' or 'G', while 'Y'
represents a pyrimidine, 'T' or 'C', and 'W' represents 'A' or 'T'.
(See `the motility intro
<http://cartwheel.caltech.edu/motility/intro.html>`__ for the whole
list.)  The point of using IUPAC motifs is that it lets you represent
motifs like "A or G, followed by a T, C, T, followed by a A or a T"
more compactly: "RTCTW", in this case.

motility, of course, lets you search DNA sequence with IUPAC motifs using
the ``find_iupac`` function:

 >>> sequence = "gatacATCTAtatgcata"
 >>> motif = "RTCTW"
 >>> motility.find_iupac(sequence, motif)
 ((5, 10, 1, 'ATCTA'),)

motility goes one better, however, and lets you specify a number of
mismatches as an optional third parameter:

 >>> mismatches=1
 >>> motility.find_iupac(sequence, motif, mismatches)
 ((5, 10, 1, 'ATCTA'), (8, 13, -1, 'ATATA'), (2, 7, -1, 'ATGTA'))

Searching with matrices
=======================

motility also lets you search for binding sites based on matrix scores.
The basic idea is pretty simple: given a set of scores for A, C, G, and
T in each position of a binding site, motility will score each potential
binding site by summing the scores of the individual positions.

Here's a very simple length=2 case; the order of the numbers corresponds
to alphabetical order of the nucleotides, A, C, G, and T:

 >>> matrix_tuple = ((1, 0, 0, 0),
 ...                 (0, 0, 1, 0))
 >>> matrix = motility.PWM(matrix_tuple)

This matrix scores 'AG' with 2, 'AN' with 1, and 'NG' with 1.  All other
combinations of two bases have a score of 0:

 >>> matrix.calc_score('AG')
 2.0
 >>> matrix.calc_score('AA')
 1.0
 >>> matrix.calc_score('TG')
 1.0
 >>> matrix.calc_score('TT')
 0.0
 >>> matrix.calc_score('GA')
 0.0

Matrices can be of arbitrary length, and they can be used in either
"position-weight matrix" form, where high-scoring sites are considered
good, or "energy-operator" form, where low-scoring sites are considered
good.

You can do a bunch of things with matrices.  You can calculate the length
of the matrix, which is equivalent to the length of the sites that matrix
will find:

 >>> len(matrix)
 2

You can calculate minimum and maximum scores:

 >>> matrix.min_score(False)
 0.0
 >>> matrix.max_score()
 2.0

You can also calculate the set of sites with scores over a
particular threshold, with the PWM representation:

 >>> matrix.generate_sites_over(1)
 ('AA', 'AC', 'AG', 'AT', 'CG', 'GG', 'TG')

(Note that this doesn't generate reverse complements!)

And, of course, you can also find matches to this matrix in longer
sequences:

 >>> sequence = "aaaaaaaaaaAGggggggggg"
 >>> matrix.find(sequence, 2.0)
 ((10, 12, 1, 'AG'),)

As with IUPAC motifs, above, 'matrix.find' returns a tuple of tuples:
(start, stop, orientation, match).

Constructing IUPAC motifs
=========================

motility has a convenient function to create an IUPAC motif from a list
of sites: ``make_iupac_motif``.

 >>> sites = [ 'AGATAA',
 ...           'TGATAA',
 ...           'AGATAG' ]
 >>> motility.make_iupac_motif(sites)
 'WGATAR'

Constructing matrix representations of motifs
=============================================

motility has a few functions to help you create matrices.

Position-Weight Matrices
------------------------

The ``make_PWM`` function makes a Position-Weight Matrix function
for you:

 >>> sites = [ 'AGATAA',
 ...           'TGATAA',
 ...           'AGATAG' ]
 >>> pwm = motility.make_PWM(sites)
 >>> print pwm.max_score(), pwm.min_score()
 5.33333333333 0.0
 >>> print pwm
 [[0.66666666666666663, 0.0, 0.0, 0.33333333333333331],
  [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
  [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
  [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
  [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
  [0.66666666666666663, 0.0, 0.33333333333333331, 0.0]]

(Yes, matrices are ugly when printed!)

Here, ``make_PWM`` creates a PWM that calculates the frequency of each
nucleotide in each position; this PWM will then rank sites by their
similarity to the input sites.  We can now calculate the
scores of all three input sites, plus a few more:

 >>> for site in [ 'AGATAA', 'TGATAA', 'AGATAG', 'GGATAA', 'GCGCGC' ]:
 ...   print site, pwm.calc_score(site)
 AGATAA 5.33333333333
 TGATAA 5.0
 AGATAG 5.0
 GGATAA 4.66666666667
 GCGCGC 0.0

Energy operators
----------------

You can also create "energy operators", which use a scoring system that's
the reverse of the PWM scoring system:

 >>> sites = [ 'AGATAA',
 ...           'TGATAA',
 ...           'AGATAG' ]
 >>> operator = motility.make_operator(sites)
 >>> print operator.max_score(), operator.min_score()
 7.74240202182 0.0

 >>> for site in [ 'AGATAA', 'TGATAA', 'AGATAG', 'GGATAA', 'GCGCGC' ]:
 ...   print site, operator.calc_energy(site)
 AGATAA 0.0
 TGATAA 0.405465108108
 AGATAG 0.405465108108
 GGATAA 1.09861228867
 GCGCGC 7.74240202182

There are a few different reasons why you might use energy operators;
one reason is that the consensus sequence always has a score of 0, and
another reason is that their scores represent an information-theoretic
or statistical-mechanical measure on motif content.  Check out Stormo
(2007) for a review.

General matrix utility functions
--------------------------------

I won't take a position on which of these matrix functions you should
use; everyone has their own favorite, and you can read about mine in
Brown and Callan (2004).  The most important thing is that you can
easily use motility to build and search with whatever kind of matrix
you want, because I've included a flexible ``make_matrix`` function: ::

 make_matrix(sites, cell_fn, cls=None)

This function is actually used by both the ``make_PWM`` and ``make_operator``
functions: all that is varied is the ``cell_fn`` and the ``cls``.  Here's
an example:

 >>> def calc_pwm_entries(count, max_count, sum_count):
 ...   return float(count) / float(sum_count)

 >>> sites = [ 'AGATAA',
 ...           'TGATAA',
 ...           'AGATAG' ]

 >>> matrix = motility.make_matrix(sites, calc_pwm_entries)

The ``make_matrix`` function takes each column in the sites list and
counts the number of times each base appears in that column.  Then,
for each base, it calls the ``calc_pwm_entries`` function with the
number of times that base occurs, the maximum number of times any one
base occurs, and the total number of sites.  This lets you calculate
most of the popular kinds of matrices; here's the output using
``calc_pwm_entries``:
 
 >>> import pprint
 >>> pprint.pprint(matrix)
 [[0.66666666666666663, 0.0, 0.0, 0.33333333333333331],
  [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
  [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
  [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
  [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
  [0.66666666666666663, 0.0, 0.33333333333333331, 0.0]]

Yep, it's identical to the PWM output, above!  Note that the optional
``cls`` argument specifies a class to apply to the returned matrix;
that way you can get back "rich" objects like motility.PWM and
motility.EnergyOperator, rather than raw matrices.

Let's do two more examples, just to pound the information in.  First,
let's build a winner-takes-all cell calculation function:

 >>> def winner_takes_all(base_count, max_count, sum_count):
 ...   if base_count == max_count: return 1
 ...   return 0

 >>> sites = [ 'AGATAA',
 ...           'TGATAA',
 ...           'AGATAG' ]

 >>> matrix = motility.make_matrix(sites, winner_takes_all)
 >>> pprint.pprint(matrix)
 [[1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0]]

This function puts a "1" in a cell if and only if that cell represents
the "consensus" nucleotide for that position.

Here's a slightly different PWM-calculating function that works as a
fraction of max_count rather than sum_count:

 >>> def calc_fn(base_count, max_count, sum_count):
 ...   return float(base_count) / float(max_count)

If we apply it to the same set of sites, we get:

 >>> matrix = motility.make_matrix(sites, calc_fn)
 >>> pprint.pprint(matrix)
 [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5],
  [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
  [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
  [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
  [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
  [1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0]]

which will rank sites in the same order as the default PWM form, but with
different scores.

Calculating thresholds
======================

The trickiest thing to do with PWMs is not to build the PWM, but to
actually use it.  You see, ``pwm.find`` scores *every* motif, unlike
the ``find_exact`` and ``find_iupac`` functions, which only find matching
motifs.  So, you need to set a threshold for ``pwm.find``, below which
it will discard motifs.

How do you set that threshold?

First, let's look again at how the function scores sites:

 >>> sites = [ 'AGATAA',
 ...           'TGATAA',
 ...           'AGATAG' ]
 >>> pwm = motility.make_PWM(sites)

 >>> for site in [ 'AGATAA', 'TGATAA', 'AGATAG', 'GGATAA', 'GCGCGC' ]:
 ...   print site, pwm.calc_score(site)
 AGATAA 5.33333333333
 TGATAA 5.0
 AGATAG 5.0
 GGATAA 4.66666666667
 GCGCGC 0.0

Hmm, I wonder what sites score above a 4.5?

 >>> pprint.pprint(pwm.generate_sites_over(4.5))
 ('AGATAA',
  'AGATAC',
  'AGATAG',
  'AGATAT',
  'CGATAA',
  'GGATAA',
  'TGATAA',
  'TGATAG')

Well, that's not too much of a surprise -- all of those sites have the
core ``GATA`` in them, which means they have a minimum score of 4.0,
plus an A at the end or the beginning.  (Go back to the PWM's matrix
representation if you don't see why the scores work out this way.)

Let's rank them and print them out with their scores: first, generate
the sites & their scores:

 >>> sites_45 = pwm.generate_sites_over(4.5)
 >>> sites_45 = [ (site, pwm.calc_score(site)) for site in sites_45 ]

Now write a custom sort function to sort 'em appropriately (top down,
by second element, the score):

 >>> def sort_by_score(a, b):
 ...   return -cmp(a[1], b[1])

and... sort!

 >>> sites_45.sort(sort_by_score)
 >>> pprint.pprint(sites_45)
 [('AGATAA', 5.333333333333333),
  ('TGATAA', 5.0),
  ('AGATAG', 4.9999999999999991),
  ('CGATAA', 4.666666666666667),
  ('GGATAA', 4.666666666666667),
  ('AGATAC', 4.6666666666666661),
  ('AGATAT', 4.6666666666666661),
  ('TGATAG', 4.6666666666666661)]

You'll note that the three input sites rank highest (which will not
always be true for a PWM, but is true for this simple example).  The
second two sites are equivalent in score (except for rounding errors),
and the next five sites are all of the remaining sites with the core
'GATA' accompanied by precisely one 'A'.

The point of this whole exercise, you may remember, was this: how do you
figure out what threshold to set?  My answer is this: look at your input
sites, ranked by score, and then set your cutoff somewhere in that range.
Then count how many other sites you would find with that threshold.

A good shorthand for this process is to use the ``weight_sites_over``
function:

 >>> pwm.weight_sites_over(4.5)
 0.001953125

which is just

 >>> len(sites_45) / float(4096)
 0.001953125

or the number of sites *over* the threshold, divided by the total number
of sites.  In a perfect world, this weight number would be the probability
of finding such a site randomly; the higher it gets, the more likely it
is that your threshold is garbage.
