'motility' is entirely standalone; you don't need anything other than
GCC to build the C++ library, and you don't need anything other than
Python to build the Python library.

Configuration:

   * set the version/location of the Python installation you want to use
     in 'Makefile'.  (By default it uses whatever version is in your path.)

To build:

   * run 'make'

To install:

   * run 'make install'

After installation, the Python library will be installed as module
'motility'.
