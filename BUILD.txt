'motility' is entirely standalone; you don't need anything other than
CMake and GCC to build the C++ library, and you don't need anything
other than Python to build the Python library.

Configuration:

   * run 'cmake .' in the motility top directory.

To build:

   * run 'make'

To install:

   * run 'make install'

After installation, the Python library will be installed as module
'motility'.
